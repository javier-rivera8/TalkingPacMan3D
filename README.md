# TalkingPacMan3D
Talking PacMan game using c++ openframeworks were the objective of the game is to kill PacMan. All the models were made by myself using blender and the ui with photoshop.

# Game Concept:
This game is about a talking PacMan where you can interact with him by speaking to through the microphone and playing mini games to earn coins. The games goal is to kill the PacMan with a special potion.
# Technology Stack:

I used the C++ programming language to develop the game logic and mechanics.
openFrameworks: This is an open-source C++ toolkit designed to assist in the development of creative coding projects, such as games, interactive art, and multimedia applications.
Blender: You've used Blender to create 3D models for your characters and possibly other game elements. Blender is a popular open-source 3D creation suite.
Photoshop: Photoshop was used to design the user interface (UI) elements of the game.
# Game Elements:

Characters: I designed my own 3D models for Pac-Man and the envirement.
UI Design: Created the user interface elements of the game using Photoshop. This includes menus, buttons, and any other graphical elements the player interacts with.
Objective and Gameplay:
The objective of the game is to play minigames and earn coins so you can kill the PacMan.

# Development Process:

Used Blender to create 3D models of characters and enviroment.
I've designed the user interface elements using Photoshop, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
Using openFrameworks, I've written the game logic, including character movement, collision detection, and win/lose conditions.
I've integrated the 3D models created in Blender into the openFrameworks project.
The game's UI elements designed in Photoshop have been incorporated into the openFrameworks user interface.
# Potential Enhancements:

Implement different minigames.
Design different foods and enviroments.
Incorporate PacMan response voice when you speak to him.
Add sound effects and music to enhance the gaming experience.
Provide visual feedback for actions.
